<p> 	In my spare time I love to sleep, listen to music, hanging out with friends and family, and playing video games. 
I also go to school and my job at bojangles, and band practice so during the weekdays these two places take up all of my day.

<p>	When im not at school im at my job bojangles.
i was first hired early last month and after school it occupies most of my time.
during weekdays I normally work three days that consist of six hour shifts.
On weekends I only work one day but it is a nine shift which is long and terrible.
Because of this job I rarely have me time.

<p>	Most of the time I am at home, I am either sleep or playing video games, or watching a show on the internet or tv.
Games I like are nba 2k16, DC Universe Online, GTA5, and etc.
As for sleeping im sure everyone loves sleeping it is an easy way to kill time.
From time to time when I am at home I like to revisit some of my childhood memories like watching anime.
Dragon Ball z/gt was my favorite childhood tv show to watch and I use to spend countless hours in front of the tv watching it.
I also love listen to music particularly hip hop, pop, and r&b.
If im not in school then im probably at home doing any of these things.

<p> When i don't want to sit at home and be a bump on the log I enjoy going out and hanging with friends
	I do all sort of things with my friends like playing sports, playing video games, going to parties, and etc.
I don't however hang out with out my friends that often only on weekends really.
If im not at school or at home then im probably out hanging with my friends.
